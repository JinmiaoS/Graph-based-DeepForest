# Graph-based Deep Forest (Graph-based gcForest)

We propose graph-based gcForest, which is an ensemble learning framework that is capable of scanning on a graph. In graph-based gcForest, inspired by the second-order random walk in Node2Vec, we propose a non-linear graph-based Multi-Grained Scanning method, which provides us with the flexibility of feature representation based on the intrinsic graph structure.
